      description:"I am currently the chairperson of  IEEE Computer Society Student Branch Chapter of UCSC. In terms of previous volunteer work, I have completed several projects for UCSC students as well as other university students, including HelloC, DesignX, Intellihack2.0, Revivex, and IEEE induction. HelloC was the first event I attended in this society. It was especially memorable for me because I led the final session of this event for our junior batch, which was about data structures in C.",
      description1:"We later organized the Intellihack event with our senior batch. Since Intellihack was a machine learning hackathon, it was unique and innovative in comparison to other hackathons. These events provided me with a unique opportunity to upskill my leadership and teamwork skills, as well as my technical expertise.",
