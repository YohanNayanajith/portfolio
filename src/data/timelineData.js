      description:"I was the former chairperson of the IEEE Computer Society Student Branch Chapter at UCSC. In my past volunteer roles, I successfully completed various projects for both UCSC and other university students. Some notable projects include HelloC, DesignX, Intellihack2.0, Revivex, and IEEE induction. My involvement in HelloC was particularly significant as it marked the first event I attended in the society. A memorable experience was leading the final session on data structures in C for our junior batch.",
      description1:"Subsequently, we coordinated the Intellihack2.0 and Intellihack3.0 events involving both our senior and junior batches. As a machine learning hackathon, Intellihack stood out for its uniqueness and innovation compared to other hackathons. These experiences offered me valuable opportunities to enhance my leadership, teamwork, and technical skills.",

      description:"It was a community project aimed at teaching mathematics to students in 3 rural schools of Badulla district, Sri Lanka. A group of 60 university students from UCSC volunteered in this project. These 3 schools had more than 650 students in total from grade 6 to O/Ls. We carried out this project during one of the most difficult times at the country where riots happened all over the island.",
